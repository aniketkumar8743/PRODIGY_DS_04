This project analyzes and visualizes sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. 
The goal is to provide insights into how people perceive and express their opinions on social media platforms.

Algorithms Used

- Random Forest Classification: A supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks, achieving an accuracy of 91% in this project.
- Tfidf Vectorizer: A technique used for text feature extraction, transforming raw text data into numerical vectors.
- Wordcloud: A visualization tool used to represent the frequency and importance of words in the text data.

Methodology

1. Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the text data, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
2. Feature Extraction: Using Tfidf Vectorizer to extract features from the preprocessed text data.
3. Model Training: Training the Random Forest Classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) models on the extracted features.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of both models, with Random Forest achieving an accuracy of 91% and GNB achieving an accuracy of 71%.
5. Visualization: Using Wordcloud to visualize the sentiment patterns and important words in the text data.

Results

- Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 91% in sentiment classification.
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB): Achieved an accuracy of 71% in sentiment classification.
- Wordcloud Visualizations: Provided insights into the frequency and importance of words in the text data, revealing sentiment patterns and trends.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest Classification and Tfidf Vectorizer, to analyze
and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data. The results show that the Random Forest Classifier outperformed the GNB model, achieving an accuracy 
of 91%. The Wordcloud visualizations provided valuable insights into the sentiment patterns and important words in the text data
